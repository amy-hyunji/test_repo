# test-repo

This repository contains a simple Python script to test the performance on tracing.

### Usage
```sh
python main.py
```

This will generate `trace_output.json` which is the tracing result when running `main.py`

You can also get a trace by 
```sh
python example.py
```
which can be used as an example in a few-shot setting.
